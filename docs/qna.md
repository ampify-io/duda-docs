* **I discarded an element, but it continues to appear in the page**
    * Discarding an element triggers a updating of a webpage in the background. It should take a few minutes for the updated version to show up both in the preview window, and in the actual Ampified version. No further action is required. 

* **Some or all of the blog posts pages are not listed in the pages list**
    * Republish your site.

* **Product or Post Search lead to a 404 page**
    * Product and Post search widget only work on sites with SSL, meaning that the site can be reached via http**s**://www.yousite.com. Your sites should have SSL by default. If it does not, enable it in the site settings (it can take up to 24 hours to become active).

* **I uninstalled and reinstalled Ampify, and now the AMP page isnâ€™t live**
    * Republish your site.

* **I opened an AMP page directly from the 'amphtml' tag, and I reached a 'Service Unavailable' page**
* This is normal. It means that the AMP page is being updated. End users will never reach this page: the client of the 'amphtml' tag is Google Bot. When it gets this message, it knows to return in a few minutes and get updated page to store in the AMP cache.
